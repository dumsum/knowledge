## Problem Statement
*What issue does the paper address, and is it significant and worth solving? Are the authors solving a real problem or creating one?*
## Related Work
*Are there uncited related publications? Is proper credit given to previous work, and is it accurately represented? Are past lessons correctly presented?*
## Proposed Solution
*Summarise the approach, including system design and algorithms. Does the solution address the problem effectively? Is it novel or previously proposed? Does it improve on previous work? Is it convincing and feasible, with no overlooked challenges? Are alternative approaches discussed?*
## Assumptions and Limitations
*What assumptions and limitations are identified, and are they reasonable? Is the solution still useful despite them? Are there any unstated assumptions or hidden limitations? Is the solution credible despite its limitations?*
## Evaluation
*How is the solution evaluated, and is the evaluation convincing? Are appropriate metrics used, and does it align with original goals? Is the solution's cost justified? Is the evaluation comprehensive, covering all aspects of the solution? Are any measurements missing? Are weak points, assumptions, and limitations explored? Are complete results presented, avoiding biases and benchmarking crimes? Is the comparison against competing approaches fair? Is sufficient information provided to assess results? Is an appropriate baseline shown, and is important information not hidden by relative numbers?*
## Presentation
*Is the paper well-structured and clear? Are the problem and solution clearly presented with enough detail? Are high-level design choices explained first? Are concepts introduced systematically? Is the reader not overwhelmed with details? Is the presentation of evaluation results sensible? Are there no issues with grammar, spelling, or sloppiness?*
